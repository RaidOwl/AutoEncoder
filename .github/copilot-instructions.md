# Copilot Instructions for autoencoder.py

-   The script `autoencoder.py` is a Python python project within the workspace.
-   It has inline script metadata (as proposed by PEP 723) that defines the script name, required python version, and dependencies.
-   If imports which require a specific Python version or dependencies are added, keep the inline script metadata up to date.
-   You need to call the `Get Python Environment Information` tool on the `autoencoder.py` path to get the Python executable details.
-   Substitute the Python executable you get from the `Get Python Environment Information` tool anywhere you see `<python>` in these instructions.
    -   Run command for `autoencoder.py`: `<python> autoencoder.py`
    -   Script can be easily debugged from the Integrated Terminal when activated with the command `debugpy autoencoder.py` after the necessary environment is activated.
